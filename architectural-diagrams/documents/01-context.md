GURPS Online eases the burden of generating worlds and characters. It is not intended to run the campaign, simply ease the creation of it.  All generated assets are available as downloads and sharable links. Throughout this document we'll refer to a couple of people that help describe the types of users in the system and their use of it. First, we have Gary, who is the Game Master interested in creating worlds and campaigns for his friends. Next, we have Penny who is a Player interested in creating characters compatible with campaigns that Gary creates. Finally, we have Adam, who administrates the system, typically installing new assets.  All 3 use their web browser to interact with the system.  Currently, no mobile support is planned.
