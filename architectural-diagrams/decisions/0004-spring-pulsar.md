# 1. Use Spring Pulsar

## Status
Proposed

## Context
Working with the Pulsar Java library requires boilerplate code and an understanding of numerous options. A simpler programming model would improve the developer experience.

## Decision
We will use the [Spring for Apache Pulsar](https://github.com/spring-projects-experimental/spring-pulsar) project to develop the gateways to Pulsar.

## Consequences
The project is in its infancy but seems to have progressed nicely, supporting the features that this project needs. As new milestones come up, we will upgrade as well as report any bugs found during development.
